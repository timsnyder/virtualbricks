  summary: 'Frontend for Qemu Virtual Machines (VMs) and VDE virtualized network devices'
  description: |
    Virtualbricks is a frontend for the management of Qemu Virtual Machines (VMs) and VDE
    virtualized network devices (switches, channel emulators, etc.). Although it can be used to
    manage isolated VMs, its peculiar aim is to design and manage testbeds consisting of many VMs
    interconnected by VDE elements. In other words, it allows to extend the concept of VM to
    testbeds, which thanks to Virtualbricks can become entirely software-defined.
