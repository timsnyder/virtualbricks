    <p>Virtualbricks is a virtualization solution for GNU/Linux platforms. In
brief, Virtualbricks is a frontend for the management of Qemu/KVM
Virtual Machines (VMs) and VDE (Virtual Distribute Ethernet) virtualized
network devices (switches, channel emulators, etc.). It can be used to
manage either isolated VMs, or testbeds consisting of many VMs
interconnected by VDE elements, including channel emulators. Although
not exclusive, one of the most significant applications is the
virtualization of real testbeds, such as those used by the authors to
evaluate TCP and DTN (Delay-/Disruption-Tolerant Networking) protocols
in challenged networks. As well as for research, Virtualbricks is also a
very valuable educational tool, as it allows both professors and
students to make use of complete networking testbeds on their own PCs,
with obvious advantages with respect to both physical testbeds and
simulation tools. Virtualbricks has been successfully used by many years
in the course on “Protocol and Architectures for Space Networks” in the
Master courses of TLC and Computer Science Engineering of the University
of Bologna. The virtual approach to lab activities, promoted by
Virtualbricks, as well as being useful per se, proved vital to cope with
University lockdowns in the last two Covid years. Virtualbricks has
recently been ported to Python3 and GTK3.</p>
